This is a simple 2 VM gobgp test. We create netns on each VM (ns0) and assign IP addresses of 10.0.10.0/24 and 10.0.20.0/24 to the netns on vm-01 and vm-02 respectively. We next insert routes using gobgp cli and wait for the route advertizements between nodes. Note that gobgpd is running on both VMs; additionally, we use quagga/zebra to insert routes into the linux routing table. 

------
Setup
------
After the VMs have been created, do the following: 

 * Create zebra.conf file and start zebra service on each VM: 

	sudo cp zebra.conf /etc/quagga/zebra.conf 
	sudo systemctl restart zebra.service 

 * Start gobgpd on both VMs:
	vm-01: gobgpd -p -f conf/gobgpd0.conf &
	vm-02: gobgpd -p -f conf/gobgpd1.conf &

 * Add rib entries via gobgp 
	vm-01: gobgp global rib add 10.0.10.0/24
	vm-02: gobgp global rib add 10.0.20.0/24

 * Note: make sure that ipv4 forwarding is enabled. You may need to further disable
	iptable rules: sudo ufw disable 

We can now create our netns on each VM:
	vm-01: sudo misc/netns_vm-01.sh
	vm-02: sudo misc/netns_vm-02.sh


 * At this point, we should be able to ping from one netns to the other netns. For example, from vm-02: 
	$ ip netns exec ns0 ping 10.0.10.1

Useful commands:
	gobgp monitor global rib
